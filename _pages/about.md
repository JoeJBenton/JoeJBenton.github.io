# About Me

Hi, I’m Joe! I’m currently a PhD student in the [Department of Statistics](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/) at the University of Oxford, supervised by [Arnaud Doucet](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/) and [George Deligiannidis](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~deligian/). Here, I’m working on developing a theoretical understanding of generative modelling techniques, with a particular focus on diffusion models and variational autoencoders. For more about my research, see [here](https://joejbenton.com/research/).

Previously, I completed my undergraduate and master’s in mathematics at Trinity Colelge, University of Cambridge. I’ve done an assortment of research work in various fields, including multi-agent RL at [CHAI](https://humancompatible.ai/), algebraic geometry in [DPMMS](https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/) at Cambridge, global health and development interventions at [Charity Entrepreneurship](https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/), and quantitative finance at [Jane Street Capital](https://www.janestreet.com/).

Alongside my research, I’m also involved in the [Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/) movement. I coordinate the Oxford AI Safety Hub, which promotes the safe development of powerful artificial intelligence. While at Cambridge, I also helped found [Raise](https://www.joinraise.org/), a national student movement which has raised over £380,000 for the [Against Malaria Foundation](https://www.againstmalaria.com/) to date.

In my spare time, you'll typically find me running through the fields around Oxford, playing the guitar (badly!), or reading. To get in touch, you can email me at benton@stats.ox.ac.uk.
