# About Me

Hi, I'm Joe! I’m currently a PhD student in the [Department of Statistics](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/) at the University of Oxford, supervised by [Arnaud Doucet](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/) and [George Deligiannidis](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~deligian/), working on the theory of generative modeling with a focus on diffusion models. For more about my research, see [here](https://joejbenton.com/research/).

I'm particularly interested in working to ensure that [the development of powerful machine learning systems is beneficial for humanity](https://www.safe.ai/ai-risk). To this end, I've spent time at several AI safety research organisations, including [Redwood Research](https://www.redwoodresearch.org/) where I worked on mechanistic anomaly detection, the [Alignment Research Center](https://www.alignment.org/) where I worked on formalizing heuristic arguments, and the [Center for Human Compatible AI](https://humancompatible.ai/).

Outside my research, I advise the [AI Safety Hub](https://www.aisafetyhub.org/), a support organisation for students and early-stage professionals looking to work on AI safety, I am a trustee for [Raise](https://www.joinraise.org/), a UK-wide student movement which has raised over £460,000 for the Against Malaria Foundation, and consider myself a part of the [Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/) community.

In my spare time, you'll typically find me running along the river in Oxford, playing the guitar (badly!), or reading. To get in touch, you can email me at [benton@stats.ox.ac.uk](mailto:benton@stats.ox.ac.uk).
