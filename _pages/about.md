# About Me

Hi, I'm Joe! I’m currently a member of technical staff on the Alignment Science team at [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/), where I work on adversarial testing of large language models and think about how we might evaluate the alignment properties of very powerful ML systems. For more about my research, see [here](https://joejbenton.com/research/). Previously, I was a PhD student in the [Department of Statistics](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/) at the University of Oxford, where I was supervised by [Arnaud Doucet](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/) and [George Deligiannidis](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~deligian/) and worked on the theory of diffusion models.

I'm particularly interested in working to ensure that [the development of powerful machine learning systems is beneficial for humanity](https://www.safe.ai/ai-risk). To this end, I've worked at several AI safety research organisations, including [Redwood Research](https://www.redwoodresearch.org/) where I worked on mechanistic anomaly detection, the [Alignment Research Center](https://www.alignment.org/) where I worked on formalizing heuristic arguments, and the [Center for Human Compatible AI](https://humancompatible.ai/). I’ve also spent time with the [UK Frontier AI Taskforce](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/frontier-ai-taskforce-second-progress-report) (now the UK AI Safety Institute) and remain excited about building government capacity to understand and regulate frontier AI systems.

Outside my research, I am a trustee for [Raise](https://www.joinraise.org/), a UK-wide student movement which has raised over £460,000 for the Against Malaria Foundation, and consider myself a part of the [Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/) community. In my spare time, you'll typically find me running running through the hills in Berkeley, playing the guitar (badly!), or reading. To get in touch, you can email me at [benton@stats.ox.ac.uk](mailto:benton@stats.ox.ac.uk).
