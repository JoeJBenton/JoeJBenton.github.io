I'm a current PhD student in Statistics at the University of Oxford, supervised by [Arnaud Doucet](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/) and [George Deligiannidis](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~deligian/). I'm working in theoretical machine learning, with particular interests in diffusion models, variational inference and inductive biases in deep learning.

Previously, I completed my undergraduate and masters in mathematics at the University of Cambridge.

Alongside my research, I'm also involved in the [Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/) movement. Previously helped to found [Raise](https://www.joinraise.org/).
