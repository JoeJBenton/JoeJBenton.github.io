### RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

**Research Assistant**\
_Centre for Human-Compatible Artificial Intelligence, University of California Berkeley_\
Supervisor: Michael Dennis\
Built on the PAIRED algorithm for unsupervised environment design proposed by Dennis et al. (2020) to incorporate human feedback to reduce the space of environments and so improve training speed.

**Research Assistant**\
_Department of Pure Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics, University of Cambridge_\
Supervisor: Dr Dhruv Ranganathan\
Title: The enumerative geometry of rational and elliptic curves on quadric surfaces\
Adapted methods of intersection theory due to Ravi Vakil for the calculation of characteristic numbers in order to
produce more direct computations of intersection numbers on the projective plane and the torus.
