I'm a current PhD student in Statistics at the University of Oxford as part of the [StatML CDT](https://statml.io/), supervised by [Arnaud Doucet](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/) and [George Deligiannidis](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~deligian/). I'm currently working on generalising diffusion models to arbitrary state spaces, and on studying the gap in variational inference. Also interested in studying the inductive biases of neural networks.
